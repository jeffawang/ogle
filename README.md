ogle
===

`ogle` is a template for running shaders and doing shader live-coding. It originally used `ogl`, hence the name, but I've since changed it to use `regl`. It's also an experiment with using `parcel` for frontend development.

```
# start a dev server
yarn start

# build the project
yarn build
```
